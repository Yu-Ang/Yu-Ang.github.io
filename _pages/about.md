# About Me
Hello everyone! I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science (EEIS)](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/index.htm), advised by [Prof. Hancheng Lu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hclu/). I am also currently working as a Full-time Research Assistant (RA) in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Chang Wen Chen](https://chenlab.comp.polyu.edu.hk/). I have published more than 20 papers in top international journals/conferences and hold multiple invention patents.

My research interests focus on intelligent communication and multimedia (e.g., Immersive Video, Metaverse, and Digital Twin) transmission for 5G/B5G/6G wireless communication and network systems, including:
- *Video Transmission Quality Optimization*
- *Environment-Aware Robust Mobile Video Transmission*
- *NGMA (e.g., RSMA and NOMA) based Internet-of-Video Things (IoVT)*

I have also worked on speech signal processing technologies for smart healthcare, aiming to combine cutting-edge deep learning techniques with speech and linguistic signal processing, including:
- *Speech Signal-based Diagnosis and Screening for Alzheimer's Disease and Facial Paralysis*.
- *Construction of Speech Physiological Signal Resources (e.g., F0, EGG, EEG, Nasality)*
- *Deep Learning-based Quantitative Assessment for Language Impairments*
