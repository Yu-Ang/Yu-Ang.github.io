[[1] When xURLLC Meets NOMA: A Stochastic Network Calculus Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.020.2300156)

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> The advent of next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) presents stringent and unprecedented requirements for key performance indicators (KPls). As a disruptive technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) harbors the potential to fulfill these stringent KPls essential for xURLLC. However, the immaturity of research on the tail distributions of these KPls significantly impedes the application of NOMA to xURLLC. Stochastic network calculus (SNC), as a potent methodology, is leveraged to provide dependable theoretical insights into tail distribution analysis and statistical QoS provisioning (SQP). In this article, we develop a NOMA-assisted uplink xURLLC network architecture that incorporates an SNC-based SQP theoretical framework (SNC-SQP) to support tail distribution analysis in terms of delay, age-of-information (AoI), and reliability. Based on SNC-SQP, an SQP-driven power optimization problem is proposed to minimize transmit power while guaranteeing xURLLC's KPls on delay, AoI, reliability, and power consumption. Extensive simulations validate our proposed theoretical framework and demonstrate that the proposed power allocation scheme significantly reduces uplink transmit power and outperforms conventional schemes in terms of SQP performance.</details>

[[2] Statistical QoS Provisioning Analysis and Performance Optimization in xURLLC-enabled Massive MU-MIMO Networks: A Stochastic Network Calculus Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2023.3347667)

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, fundamentals and performance tradeoffs of next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) are investigated from the perspective of stochastic network calculus (SNC). An xURLLC-enabled massive MU-MIMO system model has been developed to accommodate xURLLC features. By leveraging and promoting SNC, we provide a quantitative statistical quality of service (QoS) provisioning analysis and derive the closed-form expression of upper-bounded statistical delay violation probability (UB-SDVP). Based on the proposed theoretical framework, we formulate the UB-SDVP minimization problem, which is first degenerated into a one-dimensional integer-search problem by deriving the minimum error probability (EP) detector, and then efficiently solved by the integer-form Golden-Section search algorithm. Moreover, two novel concepts, EP-based effective capacity (EP-EC) and EP-based energy efficiency (EP-EE), have been defined to characterize the tail distributions and performance tradeoffs for xURLLC. Subsequently, we formulate the EP-EC and EP-EE maximization problems, and the EP-EC maximization problem is proven to be equivalent to the UB-SDVP minimization problem, while the EP-EE maximization problem is solved with a low-complexity outer-descent inner-search collaborative algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce computational complexity compared to reference schemes and provide various tradeoffs and optimization performance of xURLLC concerning UB-SDVP, EP, EP-EC, and EP-EE.</details>

[[3] Streaming 360-degree VR video with statistical QoS provisioning in mmWave networks from delay and rate perspectives](https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2025.3543615)

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Hancheng Lu, Langtian Qin, Chang Wu, and Chang Wen Chen.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has emerged as a pivotal catalyst for unleashing the full potential of 360° virtual reality (VR). Nonetheless, the explosive growth of VR services, combined with the quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning issues of mmWave, poses formidable challenges in wireless resource allocation for mmWave-enabled 360° VR. In this paper, we propose an innovative 360° VR streaming architecture that addresses three underexplored issues: overlapping fields-of-view (FoVs), statistical QoS provisioning (SQP), and loss-tolerant active data discarding. Specifically, we first design an overlapping FoV-based optimal joint unicast and multicast (JUM) task assignment scheme, which significantly conserves wireless resources by implementing non-redundant task allocation. Leveraging stochastic network calculus (SNC), we develop a comprehensive SNC-based SQP theoretical framework from delay and rate perspectives. Additionally, we propose two corresponding optimal adaptive joint resource allocation and active-discarding (ADAPT-JRAAD) transmission schemes to minimize resource consumption while guaranteeing SQP performance from delay and rate perspectives, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate the outstanding performance of the designed optimal JUM task assignment scheme in conserving wireless resources. Moreover, comprehensive comparisons against six benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed two ADAPT-JRAAD schemes in resource utilization, flexible rate control, and robust queue management.</details>

[[4] Topology-Aware Microservice Architecture in Edge Networks: Deployment Optimization and Implementation](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2025.3539312)

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Chang Wu, Fangyu Zhang, Chengdi Lu, Yongsheng Huang, and Hancheng Lu.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> As a ubiquitous deployment paradigm, integrating microservice architecture (MSA) into edge networks promises to enhance the flexibility and scalability of services. However, it also presents significant challenges stemming from dispersed node locations and intricate network topologies. In this paper, we have proposed a topology-aware MSA characterized by a three-tier network traffic model encompassing the service, microservices, and edge node layers. This model meticulously characterizes the complex dependencies between edge network topologies and microservices, mapping microservice deployment onto link traffic to accurately estimate communication delay. Building upon this model, we have formulated a weighted sum communication delay optimization problem considering different types of services. Then, a novel topology-aware and individual-adaptive microservices deployment (TAIA-MD) scheme is proposed to solve the problem efficiently, which accurately senses the network topology and incorporates an individual-adaptive mechanism in a genetic algorithm to accelerate the convergence and avoid local optima. Extensive simulations show that, compared to the existing deployment schemes, TAIA-MD improves the communication delay performance by approximately 30% to 60% and effectively enhances the overall network performance. Furthermore, we implement the TAIA-MD scheme on a practical microservice physical platform. The experimental results demonstrate that TAIA-MD achieves superior robustness in withstanding link failures and network fluctuations.</details>

[[5] Performance Optimization in RSMA-assisted Uplink xURLLC IIoT Networks with Statistical QoS Provisioning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037391)

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Hancheng Lu, Chang Wu, Langtian Qin, and Xiaobo Guo.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> Industry 5.0 and beyond networks have driven the emergence of numerous mission-critical services exemplified by neXt-generation ultra-reliable low-latency communication (xURLLC). To guarantee low-latency requirements, xURLLC heavily relies on short-blocklength packets with sporadic arrival traffic. As a disruptive multi-access technique, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the quality of service (QoS) and flexibly manage interference for xURLLC. In this paper, we study an innovative RSMA-assisted uplink xURLLC industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) (RSMA-xURLLC-IIoT) network, which takes into account imperfect CSI and finite blocklength (FBL) regimes. We develop a novel theoretical framework leveraging stochastic network calculus (SNC) aimed at revealing insights into statistical QoS provisioning (SQP). Building upon this framework, we formulate the SQP-driven short-packet size maximization and transmit power minimization problems, aiming to guarantee the SQP performance to delay, decoding, and reliability while maximizing the short-packet size and minimizing the transmit power, respectively. By exploiting Monte-Carlo methods, we have thoroughly validated the reliability of the developed theoretical framework. Moreover, through extensive comparison analysis with state-of-the-art multi-access techniques, including non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA), we have demonstrated the superior performance gains achieved by the proposed network.</details>

[[6] Enhancing xURLLC with RSMA-Assisted Massive-MIMO Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2025.3581971)

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Hancheng Lu, Chenwu Zhang, Yansha Deng, and Arumugam Nallanathan.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> Massive connections of diverse mission-critical devices have sparked people’s envisioning for next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC), prompting the design of customized next-generation advanced transceivers (NGAT). Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a pivotal technology for NGAT design, given its robustness to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and resilience to quality of service (QoS). Additionally, xURLLC urgently necessitates large-scale access techniques, thus massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is anticipated to integrate with RSMA to enhance xURLLC. In this paper, we develop an innovative RSMA-assisted massive-MIMO xURLLC (RSMA-mMIMO-xURLLC) framework tailored to accommodate xURLLC’s critical QoS constraints in finite blocklength (FBL) regimes. Leveraging uplink pilot training under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, we estimate channel gains and customize linear precoders for efficient downlink short-packet data transmission. Subsequently, we formulate a joint rate-splitting, beamforming, and transmit antenna selection optimization problem to maximize the total effective transmission rate (ETR). Addressing this multi-variable coupled non-convex problem, we decompose it into three corresponding subproblems and propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm for efficient optimization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that compared with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space division multiple access (SDMA), the developed architecture accommodates larger-scale access and improves total ETR by 15.3% and 41.91%, respectively.</details>

[[7] DMSA: A Decentralized Microservice Architecture for Edge Networks (Accepted)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00883)

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Chengdi Lu, Chang Wu, Yongsheng Huang, Fengqian Guo, Hancheng Lu, and Chang Wen Chen.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> The dispersed node locations and complex topologies of edge networks, combined with intricate dynamic microservice dependencies, render traditional centralized microservice architectures (MSAs) unsuitable. In this paper, we propose a decentralized microservice architecture (DMSA), which delegates scheduling functions from the control plane to edge nodes. DMSA redesigns and implements three core modules of microservice discovery, monitoring, and scheduling for edge networks to achieve precise awareness of instance deployments, low monitoring overhead and measurement errors, and accurate dynamic scheduling, respectively. Particularly, DMSA has customized a microservice scheduling scheme that leverages multi-port listening and zero-copy forwarding to guarantee high data forwarding efficiency. Moreover, a dynamic weighted multi-level load balancing algorithm is proposed to adjust scheduling dynamically with consideration of reliability, priority, and response delay. Finally, we have implemented a physical verification platform for DMSA. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art and traditional scheduling schemes, DMSA effectively counteracts link failures and network fluctuations, improving the service response delay and execution success rate by approximately 60% ~ 75% and 10% ~ 15%, respectively.</details>

**<u>Yuang Chen</u>**, Chang Wu, Fengqian Guo, Hancheng Lu, and Chang Wen Chen.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the sixth-generation mobile communication (6G) discussed by IMT-2030, significant emphasis is placed on massive communications and ubiquitous connectivity, which has greatly driven the explosive growth in the number of devices with stringent timeliness demands, represented by the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this paper, we propose an age-of-information (AoI)-aware multi-base station (BS) real-time monitoring framework to support large-scale IIoT access. We formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem with the goal of minimizing long-term average AoI, while considering the delay, energy consumption, resource allocation, and task scheduling constraints. For the task offloading subproblem, we equivalently transform it into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and propose an innovative branching-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Branch-D3QN) algorithm to effectively tackle it, significantly reducing the action space complexity from exponential to $\mathcal{Q}(n)$, enhancing convergence speed and stability. For the resource allocation subproblem, we prove the convexity of this subproblem by deriving the semi-definite property of the Hessian matrix of bandwidth and computation resources. Furthermore, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm for efficient joint task offloading and resource allocation to achieve optimal average AoI performance. Extensive simulations show that our proposed Branching-D3DN algorithm outperforms both the state-of-the-art DRL methods and classical heuristics, achieving up to $75\%$ enhanced convergence speed and at least $22\%$ reduced long-term average AoI.</details>

[[9] Statistical QoS Provision in Business-Centric Networks (Accepted)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197211)

Chang Wu<sup>†</sup>, **<u>Yuang Chen</u><sup>†</sup>** (Co-First Author), and Hancheng Lu.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> More refined resource management and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning are the critical goals of wireless communication technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel Business-Centric Network (BCN) aimed at enabling scalable QoS provisioning, based on a cross-layer framework that captures the relationship between application, transport parameters, and channels. We investigate both continuous flow and event-driven flow models, presenting key QoS metrics such as throughput, delay, and reliability. By jointly considering power and bandwidth allocation, transmission parameters, and AP network topology across layers, we optimize weighted resource efficiency with statistical QoS provisioning. To address the coupling among parameters, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is Collaborative Optimization among Heterogeneous Actors with Experience Sharing (COHA-ES). Power and sub-channel (SC) Actors representing multiple APs are jointly optimized under the unified guidance of a common critic. Additionally, we introduce a novel multithreaded experience-sharing mechanism to accelerate training and enhance rewards. Extensive comparative experiments validate the effectiveness of our DRL framework in terms of convergence and efficiency. Moreover, comparative analyses demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the BCN structure in enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency.</details>

Chengdi Lu<sup>†</sup>, **<u>Yuang Chen</u><sup>†</sup>** (Co-First Author), Fangyu Zhang, and Hancheng Lu.
<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> In data centers, large-scale many-to-one traffic can rapidly exhaust switch buffers and trigger priority-based flow control (PFC) pause, resulting in increased flow completion time (FCT) for uncongested flows. To address this issue, we propose an innovative switch-side fast and accurate flow control (FAFC) scheme. By differentially allocating pause time for each port during congestion, FAFC can minimize the performance loss for uncongested flows. Furthermore, FAFC is also coupled with an effective queue length prediction algorithm to enable proactive and reliable estimation of the congestion level. Extensive system-level simulations demonstrate that FAFC can flexibly allocate pause times across congested ports, which are not only compatible with existing PFC but also do not require per-flow states. We implemented FAFC in P4 programmable switches, showing it as lightweight flow control method that is portable for implementation in hardware. Remarkably, our large-scale simulations illustrate that compared to traditional PFC, FAFC improves the average FCT slowdown and 95% FCT slowdown by 10.6% and 23.3%, respectively, under Hadoop workload when performing HPCC congestion control.</details>

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0 extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69 Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2%. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.</details>

[[12] EGGNet: Learning Temporal Boundaries of Glottal Cycles from EGG (Under Major Revisions)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yu-Ang/Yu-Ang.github.io/main/assets/TSP_EGGNet_Submission.pdf)

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes an innovative wide-context multi-branch convolutional model named EGGNet for the first time, which overcomes the bottlenecks of glottal closure instant (GCI) detection from EGG signals through three key technical breakthroughs. The electroglottograph (EGG) has been extensively adopted as a direct and reliable physiological signal for high-quality speech annotation. However, the most popular methods represented by *peakdet* nowadays frequently encounter issues of false alarms and missed detections. This paper proposes an innovative wide-context multi-branch convolutional model named EGGNet for the first time, which overcomes the bottlenecks of glottal closure instant (GCI) detection from EGG signals through three key technical breakthroughs. Firstly, EGGNet incorporates a temporal evaluation optimization, introducing a tolerance-window-based GCI detection algorithm that effectively mitigates distortion caused by the sparsity of temporal localization and controls the GCI event matching error within ±20 sampling points from tens of thousands of samples per second. Secondly, EGGNet proposes a greedy-based one-to-one matching strategy that eliminates the multi-to-one or one-to-multi evaluation bias common in traditional methods, thereby ensuring strict alignment between detection results and ground truth labels. Furthermore, EGGNet proposes a cascaded supervision architecture, which establishes a collaborative training mechanism between soft and hard labels, effectively balancing sensitivity and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, after training on the PTDB-TUG dataset, EGGNet significantly outperforms *peakdet* and achieves F1 scores of 96.6%, 96.2%, and 90.3% on CSTR-FDA, KEELE, and MOCHA-TIMIT, respectively. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that EGG exhibits superior performance on high-noise corpora, and its soft-hard cascaded supervision improves the precision–recall balance metric by 6.5% compared with single-supervision schemes.</details>

[[13] Physiological Signal-Driven QoE Optimization for Wireless Virtual Reality Transmission (Under Review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09151)

Chang Wu<sup>†</sup>, **<u>Yuang Chen</u><sup>†</sup>** (Co-First Author), Yiyuan Chen, Fengqian Guo, Xiaowei Qin, and Hancheng Lu,

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abrupt resolution changes in virtual reality (VR) streaming can significantly impair the quality-of-experience (QoE) of users, particularly during transitions from high to low resolutions. Existing QoE models and transmission schemes inadequately address the perceptual impact of these shifts. To bridge this gap, this article proposes, for the first time, an innovative physiological signal-driven QoE modeling and optimization framework that fully leverages users' electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and skin activity signals. This framework precisely captures the temporal dynamics of physiological responses and resolution changes in VR streaming, enabling accurate quantification of resolution upgrades' benefits and downgrades' impacts. Integrated the proposed QoE framework into the radio access network (RAN) via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, adaptive transmission strategies have been implemented to allocate radio resources dynamically, which mitigates short-term channel fluctuations and adjusts frame resolution in response to channel variations caused by user mobility. By prioritizing long-term resolution while minimizing abrupt transitions, the proposed solution achieves an 88.7% improvement in resolution and an 81.0% reduction in handover over the baseline. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this physiological signal-driven strategy, underscoring the promise of edge AI in immersive media services.</details>

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper addresses the limitations of the confidence-driven unvoiced estimation (CUE) strategy commonly adopted in deep learning-based F0 extraction methods, particularly with respect to adaptability and explicit voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) modeling. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework, JUND-F0 (Joint V/UV Detection and F0 extraction). JUND-F0 integrates two innovative strategies: the Joint F0 and V/UV learning method (JFUV) and the Unified F0 and V/UV detection method (UFUV). JFUV incorporates V/UV information directly into the network, enabling simultaneous learning of voice activity and pitch distributions. UFUV, in contrast, treats unvoiced frames as an explicit class within the network output, supporting end-to-end V/UV judgments alongside precise pitch predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that JUND-F0 achieves comprehensive improvements over state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding superior performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), gross pitch error (GPE), raw pitch accuracy (RPA), and voicing decision error (VDE).</details>

[[15] NOMA-Assisted Multi-BS MEC Networks for Delay-Sensitive and Computation-Intensive IoT Applications (Under Review)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yu-Ang/Yu-Ang.github.io/main/assets/NMBM.pdf)

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3\% and 14.7\% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.</details>

[[16] Segment Routing Header (SRH)-Aware Traffic Engineering in Hybrid IP/SRv6 Networks With Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11303321)

Shuyi Liu<sup>†</sup>, **<u>Yuang Chen</u><sup>†</sup>** (Co-First Author), Zhengze Li, Fangyu Zhang, Hancheng Lu, Xiaobo Guo, and Lizhe Liu,

<details><summary>Click to view details</summary><strong>Abstract:</strong> Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) gives operators explicit path control and alleviates network congestion, making it a compelling technique for traffic engineering (TE). Yet two practical hurdles slow adoption. First, a one-shot upgrade of every traditional device is prohibitively expensive, so operators must prioritize which devices to upgrade. Second, the Segment Routing Header (SRH) increases packet size; if TE algorithms ignore this overhead, they will underestimate link load and may cause congestion in practice. We address both challenges with DRL-TE, an algorithm that couples deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a lightweight local search (LS) step to minimize the network’s maximum link utilization (MLU). DRL-TE first identifies the smallest set of critical devices whose upgrade yields the largest drop in MLU, enabling hybrid IP/SRv6 networks to approach optimal performance with minimal investment. It then computes SRH-aware routes, and the DRL agent, augmented by a fast LS refinement, rapidly reduces MLU even under traffic variation. Experiments on an 11-node hardware testbed and three larger simulated topologies show that upgrading about 30% of devices allows DRL-TE to match fully upgraded networks and reduce MLU by up to 34% compared with existing algorithms. DRL-TE also maintains high performance under link failures and traffic variations, offering a cost-effective and robust path toward incremental SRv6 deployment. </details>

<details><summary>Click to view book review</summary><strong>读后感:</strong> 对于康普生家族的衰落, 班吉的意识流、昆丁的自杀、杰生的贪婪，以及迪尔西的旁观。福克纳探讨了时间、衰败、性别与种族等主题，南方哥特式的氛围浓郁而压抑。它让我重新思考家庭关系的复杂性：表面喧哗之下，是每个人内心的骚动与绝望。昆丁对妹妹凯蒂的痴迷，不仅是个人悲剧，更是时代道德崩塌的象征。《喧哗与骚动》激发我探索叙事理论，如何通过多视角揭示真相，去深入感受到生命的无常与无意义，正如标题源于莎士比亚的 “人生如梦，一场空虚的喧哗与骚动”。它教会我，在追求知识时，不要忽略情感的深度。这部作品的语言实验性极强，初读时困惑，但反复品味后，如获至宝。它让我在个人生活中，更注重倾听内心的声音，避免被表象迷惑，并在学术会议中用类似结构呈现复杂研究结果。</details>

<details><summary>Click to view book review</summary><strong>读后感:</strong> 这是一部简洁却深刻的荒谬主义杰作，读后让我对存在主义哲学有了更深的共鸣。默尔索是一个 “局外人”，他对母亲的死亡、爱情和审判都表现出冷漠的态度，最终因 “没有哭泣” 而被社会判处死刑。加缪通过默尔索的视角，揭示了人类存在的荒谬：生活没有内在意义，我们却被社会规范强加意义。它让我反思现代人的异化：在快节奏的社会中，我们常常像默尔索一样，麻木地活着，却因不符合 “正常” 而被排斥。我常常思考那句 “在世界的某个角落，有一个温柔的微笑在等待着我”，它提醒我寻找生命的积极面。尽管主题沉重，但加缪的哲学让我学会接受荒谬，并从中创造意义。</details>

***Here are some of my favorite movies, hoping you enjoy them.***

- **寄生虫——导演: 奉俊昊; 主演: 宋康昊, 李善均, 赵茹珍, 崔宇植, 朴素丹, [Click to watch](https://www.yfsp.tv/play/9r2DIQ3aEP1)**
<details><summary>Click to view movie review</summary><strong>观后感:</strong> 一个底层贫困家庭如何巧妙 “寄生” 于富裕家庭? 导演以黑色幽默的手法，层层铺设悬念，将社会阶级冲突赤裸裸地呈现在观众眼前。我被影片的叙事节奏深深吸引。前半部分轻松搞笑，穷人一家机智地潜入富人生活，仿佛一部喜剧；后半部分急转直下，暴雨之夜的转折点让人心跳加速，揭示出贫富差距的残酷现实。穷人身上的 “气味” 成为贯穿始终的隐喻，它不仅仅是身体的异味，更是底层人民的自卑与绝望，无法抹去的阶级烙印。富人家庭看似完美，却在无意中流露出对穷人的轻蔑，这种无形的壁垒如寄生虫般侵蚀着社会肌理。这部电影让我反思当下社会的阶层固化问题。在全球化时代，贫富分化日益加剧，穷人努力向上爬，却往往陷入更深的泥沼。奉俊昊通过精湛的镜头语言和隐喻符号，如地下室与豪宅的对比，石头与暴雨的象征，深刻剖析了人性中的贪婪、嫉妒与无奈。观后，我不由得感慨：寄生并非穷人的专利，富人也可能被自己的优越感所寄生。《寄生虫》更像是一面照见社会阴暗面的镜子。它提醒我们，唯有正视不公，才能寻求真正的和谐。强烈推荐大家观看，相信每个人都会从中获得不同的启发！</details>

- **阿甘正传——导演: 罗伯特·泽米吉斯; 主演: 汤姆·汉克斯, 莎莉·菲尔德, 埃尔维斯·普雷斯利, 罗宾·莱特·潘, [Click to watch](https://www.yfsp.tv/play/V0Cp7zEZXgI)**
<details><summary>Click to view movie review</summary><strong>观后感:</strong> 这是一部永恒的经典，智商仅有75的阿甘，以纯真之心穿越美国历史的风雨人生。从越南战场到商业传奇，他的人生如羽毛般随风飘荡，却总在关键时刻落地生根。汤姆·汉克斯的演绎，让这个 “傻瓜” 成为智慧的化身，影片以温暖的叙事，交织着战争、爱情与时代变迁。我被阿甘的单纯与坚韧深深打动。他不计较智商的局限，只凭一颗赤诚之心前行：跑步穿越大陆，象征着对未知的勇敢拥抱；对珍妮的执着，映照出爱情的纯净与无悔。人生本无定式，阿甘的经历教导我们，命运并非宿命，而是由无数小选择织就的网。就像他母亲说的，“生活就像一盒巧克力，你永远不知道下一颗是什么味道。”这句台词如哲理般深刻，提醒我们面对不确定性时，保持乐观与行动力。智者往往被算计所缚，而“愚者”却因无畏而自由。阿甘的成功，不是天赋，而是善良与坚持的结晶。在浮躁的当下，这部影片如镜子，照见我们内心的迷失：追求太多，往往忽略了简单的幸福。人生无需完美蓝图，只需一步一脚印。阿甘教会我们，真正的智慧在于拥抱当下，顺势而为，却永不放弃梦想。无论时代如何变幻，内心的纯真才是永恒的指南针。</details>

- **肖申克的救赎——导演: 弗兰克·德拉邦特; 主演: 蒂姆·罗宾斯/摩根·弗里曼/鲍勃·冈顿, [Click to watch](https://www.yfsp.tv/play/Etpgz6WujTJ)**
<details><summary>Click to view movie review</summary><strong>观后感:</strong> 银行家安迪因冤狱入狱，在肖申克监狱中以智慧与坚韧追求自由的故事。蒂姆·罗宾斯和摩根·弗里曼的演绎，将希望与友谊演绎得淋漓尽致。影片以监狱为背景，却探讨了人生的本质：自由不止于身体，更在于心灵的解放。我被安迪的隐忍与瑞德的智慧深深触动。安迪用19年凿穿监狱墙，象征着坚持的伟力；他为狱友建立图书馆，点亮知识之光，提醒我们即使在黑暗中，也能播撒希望的种子。瑞德的那句 “希望是件好东西，也许是人间至善”，如哲理般深刻，揭示了希望并非天赐，而是通过行动铸就的盾牌。人生如监狱，困境如枷锁，但内心的自由无人能夺。面对逆境，许多人如布鲁克斯般迷失，选择放弃；安迪却证明，救赎源于自我——不是等待奇迹，而是主动雕琢命运。友谊在此中绽放，安迪与瑞德的羁绊，映照出人性中的温暖与互助：一人点灯，照亮彼此。在浮华的世界，我们往往被物质牢笼所缚，忽略了内心的追求。真正的救赎，不是逃离现实，而是直面它、改造它。希望如海滩上的石子，平凡却坚硬，能磨平岁月的棱角。无论身处何地，坚持与希望，便是通往自由的钥匙。值得每个人反复体悟。</details>

- **东京物语——小津安二郎代表作之一, [Click to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQALLTjf3GI)**
<details><summary>Click to view movie review</summary><strong>观后感:</strong> 虽然小津安二郎的《东京物语》是一部黑白电影，但丝毫不影响它是作为一部永恒的经典。一对乡下老夫妇赴东京探望子女，却在都市的冷漠中品尝孤独的滋味。影片以平静的长镜头和低机位，捕捉日常生活的细腻，犹如一幅淡墨山水画，隐含着深刻的东方禅意。我被电影中的那份隐忍的悲凉深深触动。父母的期待如秋叶般飘零，子女的忙碌却如都市霓虹般疏离。这不仅仅是家庭的疏离，更是人生的寓言：时间如流水，亲情本是桥梁，却往往在忙碌中坍塌。老夫妇的旅程，象征着生命从乡野到都市的迁徙——乡野代表纯真与根基，都市则寓意欲望与疏离。我们一生追求的 “进步”，往往以牺牲内在的温暖为代价。幸福并非外在的繁华，而是内心的守望。子女的冷淡，如镜子映照出人性中的自私：我们总在追逐未来，却遗忘了来路。父母的宽容，则教导我们，真正的爱是无言的包容，如片中那句 “人生就是这样”，道尽了无常与接受。在快节奏的现代社会，我们如片中子女般奔波，忽略了亲情的温度。人生如一场东京之旅，繁华转瞬即逝，唯有珍惜当下，方能免于悔恨。亲情如树，根深才能叶茂；疏离如风，一吹便散。</details>

- **美丽中国——一部有关中国自然主题的6集自然纪录片[Click to watch](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1XG4y1n77B?vd_source=4ba40519b8acb74a7d912dcf4b1f0fc2&spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.episodes)**
<details><summary>Click to view movie review</summary><strong>观后感:</strong> 《美丽中国》以壮阔的镜头展现了中国从喜马拉雅山脉到南海珊瑚礁的多样生态。影片穿越高原、森林、河流与海洋，捕捉珍稀物种如大熊猫、金丝猴和朱鹮的生存故事，交织人文与自然的和谐画卷。旁白优美，配乐悠扬，让人仿佛置身于这片古老而生机勃勃的土地。我被大自然的鬼斧神工深深震撼。镜头下，雪山融水滋养江河，竹海中熊猫悠然自得，揭示了生命的韧性与循环：万物相生相克，却在平衡中永续。哲理在于，自然并非人类的附庸，而是智慧的导师。它教导我们，多样性是生存的基石——从热带雨林的繁茂到戈壁沙漠的坚韧，每一种生态都如人生阶段，缺一不可。人类干预往往打破这平衡，如污染与开发带来的危机，提醒我们：贪婪如病毒，侵蚀和谐；谦卑如雨露，滋养万物。在快节奏的现代社会，这部影片如镜子，照见我们内心的荒芜：追求物质时，是否遗忘了与自然的共鸣？美丽不止于表象，而是内在的平衡与敬畏。人类如纪录片中的游牧民，应顺应自然，而非征服它。唯有守护这片土地，方能传承永恒的生机。</details>
