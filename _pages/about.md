# About Me
Hello! I am Yuang Chen (陳雨昂), a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science (EEIS)](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/index.htm), advised by [Prof. Hancheng Lu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hclu/). I am also currently working as a Full-time Research Assistant (RA) in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Chang Wen Chen](https://chenlab.comp.polyu.edu.hk/). I have published more than 20 papers in top international journals/conferences and hold multiple invention patents.

My research interests focus on intelligent communication and multimedia (e.g., Immersive Video, Metaverse, and Digital Twin) transmission for 5G/B5G/6G wireless communication and network systems, including:
- *Video Transmission Quality Optimization*
- *Environment-Aware Robust Mobile Video Transmission*
- *NGMA (e.g., RSMA and NOMA) based Internet-of-Video Things (IoVT)*

I have also worked on speech signal processing technologies for smart healthcare, aiming to combine cutting-edge deep learning techniques with speech and linguistic signal processing, including:
- *Speech Signal-based Diagnosis and Screening for Alzheimer's Disease and Facial Paralysis*.
- *Construction of Speech Physiological Signal Resources (e.g., F0, EGG, EEG, Nasality)*
- *Deep Learning-based Quantitative Assessment for Language Impairments*

[Proactively Prevent Data Center Buffer Overflow with Minimized Impact: A Fast and Accurate Flow Control Method (Under Review)](https://arxiv.org)

Chengdi Lu†, **Yuang Chen†** (Co-First Author), Fangyu Zhang, and Hancheng Lu.
- In this article, we propose an innovative switch-side fast and accurate flow control (FAFC) scheme. By differentially allocating pause time for each port during congestion, FAFC can minimize the performance loss for uncongested flows. Furthermore, FAFC is also coupled with an effective queue length prediction algorithm to enable proactive and reliable estimation of the congestion level.
